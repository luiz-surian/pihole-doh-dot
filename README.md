TZ=America/Sao_Paulo                                         # Set your timezone to make sure logs rotate at local midnight instead of at UTC midnight.
WEBPASSWORD=changeme                                         # Set your password to access Web UI
ServerIP=0.0.0.0                                             # Set to your server's LAN IP, used by web block modes and lighttpd bind address
VIRTUAL_HOST=192.168.1.100                                   # What your web server 'virtual host' is, accessing admin through this Hostname/IP allows you to make changes to the whitelist / blacklists in addition to the default 'http://pi.hole/admin/' address
PIHOLE_DNS_=127.0.0.1#5053;127.0.0.1#5153;::1#5053;::1#5153  # Upstream DNS server(s) for Pi-hole to forward queries to, seperated by a semicolon (supports non-standard ports with #[port number]) e.g 127.0.0.1#5053;8.8.8.8;8.8.4.4
IPv6=true                                                    # IPv6 Enabled.
DNSMASQ_LISTENING=all                                        # local listens on all local subnets, all permits listening on internet origin subnets in addition to local, single listens only on the interface specified.
PIHOLE_DOMAIN=lan                                            # Domain name sent by the DHCP server.
DNSMASQ_USER=root                                            # Allows running FTLDNS as non-root.
```

## ‚òï Docker usage

Just execute the script "./run.sh", it will build and run the container. The Web Admin UI will be accessible via port 1010.
Consider editing the run command to change the ports or the mounting point of the volume according to your needs.

## üìù Notes

- To use just DoH or just DoT service, set `PIHOLE_DNS_` to the same value.
 - DoH service (cloudflared) runs at 127.0.0.1#5053 and ::1#5053. Uses cloudflare (1.1.1.1 / 1.0.0.1 / 2606:4700:4700::1111 / 2606:4700:4700::1001) by default.
 - DoT service (stubby) runs at 127.0.0.1#5153 and ::1#5153. Uses cloudflare (1.1.1.1 / 1.0.0.1 / 2606:4700:4700::1111 / 2606:4700:4700::1001) by default.

- In addition to the 2 official paths, you can also map container /config to expose configuration yml files for cloudflared (cloudflared.yml) and stubby (stubby.yml).
 - Edit these files to add / remove services as you wish. The flexibility is yours.
